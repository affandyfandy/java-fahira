<h2>What is the serialVersionUID?</h2>

The serialVersionUID attribute is an identifier that is used to serialize/deserialize an object of a Serializable class. Simply put, we use the serialVersionUID attribute to remember versions of a Serializable class to verify that a loaded class and the serialized object are compatible. The serialVersionUID attributes of different classes are independent. Therefore, it is not necessary for different classes to have unique values.
